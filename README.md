# Snake

This is a project I made for fun in my spare time in order to test my skills in Python. It is an implementation of the classic "Snake" game, using the Pygame library.

Usage:

It is required that you have python3 installed on your device.

1. Navigate to the directory you have all the game files in

2. Open a terminal in that directory (or open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory through the command line)

3. Run sorter.py with the following command:
    python3 snake.py

Note: The "snake" file is an executable only compatible with Linux!
